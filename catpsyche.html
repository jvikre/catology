		<h2>The Cat Psyche</h2>
		<div class="breakafter">
		<p>Cats are extremely independent. They like to set their own schedule and do their own thing, therefore it would be crazy to compare them to a dog. This may be frustrating to those that are familiar with having dogs, however their independent nature demands respect. With proper interactions cats can be just as loyal and affectionate as dogs.</p>

		<h3>Litter Box Etiquette</h3>
		<p> Cats are very clean animals. You should have 1 cat box per cat in your household and you should clean all of them every day – this is especially important if your cat has been peeing outside of the litter box. The litter box should be in a low-traffic area where the cat will feel safe and hidden. Clay litter should be avoided, as this may be harmful to their health. The cat will clean themselves after having used the litter box and therefore will probably ingest traces of the litter – cats shouldn’t eat clay! <a href="https://www.worldsbestcatlitter.com/" target="_blank">World’s Best Cat Litter</a> (a brand) is seriously the world’s BEST cat litter – it’s made of corn which is not technically part of their diet, however it is completely non-toxic.</p>

		<h3>Socialization</h3>
		</div>
		<p>This depends on the cat but it is always best to take socialization slowly – just a minute at first, then maybe 10 minutes, and so on depending on progress. Let the cat or cat(s) have a separate area that it can retreat to if it gets stressed out.
