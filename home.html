		<h2>Why Cats Act The Way They Do</h2>
		<div id="columns">
		<p> Although we consider our housecats domesticated, they are still very much like their wild ancestors, and by this I mean extremely independent. Because of this, cats do not see their owners as, well... owners... but rather larger, non-hostile felines. <br> Even though we feed them and take care of them, they still view us as an equal or a roommate. This is important to keep in mind when trying to make a cat feel comfortable. Cats like to feel in control in their surroundings. Therefore, trying to command them to do something will probably just lead the cat to think <em>Why is this giant, ugly cat making so much noise??</em> But don&#39;t worry, there are other ways of getting them to do what you want. You just have to make them think that it&#39;s their idea.</p>

		<h3>They&#39;re Not Dogs</h3>
		<p> A common mistake for new cat owners to make is to compare them to dogs. <strong>DO NOT DO THIS!!</strong> Dogs are pack-minded creatures and will look to their owner as a wolf looks to the leader of their pack. While dogs view their humans as superior, cats view their humans as equals, or possibly even inferiors. By all means, if you suffer from a superiority complex, then maybe don&#39;t get a cat. But if you are looking for a low-maintenance, super adorable, heart attack risk reducing pet to chill with, then please keep reading.</p></section>

		<h3>Misunderstood Cats Are Frequently Given Up For Adoption</h3>
